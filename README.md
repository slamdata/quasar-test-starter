# quasar-test-starter

A project that makes it easy to start MongoDB and Quasar while testing SlamData or the Quasar API.

Can be used as a library in other projects via the modules in `Quasar.Spawn`, or on the command line through `npm` scripts.

## Command line usage

First clone this project with git:

```
git clone https://github.com/slamdata/quasar-test-starter.git
```

Ensure you have `bower` installed:

```
npm install -g bower
```

And then `cd` into `quasar-test-starter` and run `npm install`. This will will compile the PureScript code in the project to produce `quasar/spawn.js` and download a `.jar` file for Quasar.

Once these setup steps have been completed, the following commands can be used within the `quasar-test-starter` directory:

- `npm run start-clean` will start Quasar and MongoDB with a default config and the datasets in the `data` directory.
- `npm run start` will start Quasar and MongoDB without resetting the database and config. This will fail unless `start-clean` has been run at least once, as required directories will not exist on the first run of `start`.

## Hosting the SlamData front-end

When run as an executable, the content path `slamdata` is passed through as an option to Quasar, so making a symlink in the directory of this project to the `public/` folder in a SlamData project will enable testing of the front-end, hosted by the Quasar instance.

The following command can be run to simlink the folder:
```
ln -s /path/to/slamdata/public/ /path/to/quasar-test-starter/slamdata/
```

Notice that you will simlink `public/` from slamdata and rename it to `slamdata/` inside `quasar-test-starter/`.
